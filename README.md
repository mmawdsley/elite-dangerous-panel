# Elite Dangerous Control Panel

Requirements:

- 6 LEDs
- 32 digital inputs
- 1 analog input

Controller was built with the [Teensy 3.1](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensy31.html) in mind, but eventually switched to a [BU0836X](http://www.leobodnar.com/shop/index.php?main_page=product_info&cPath=94&products_id=180) board for compactness.
